Learning what ecosystems can teach us about coexistence. 

> **Weak Coexistence**: the prevention of extinction. 

- [ ] Is weak coexistence maintained by virtue of species experiencing a rapid rise in fitness relative to their aggressors at lower levels of population density? 
    - [ ] Looking for backstops
        - [ ] Habitat preference as a backstop

> **Strong Coexistence**: prevention of extinction while maintaining low variance in population levels. 

- [ ] Strong coexistence is the result of dampening
    - [ ] Look for dampening effects in nature
