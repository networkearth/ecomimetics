## TODO

- [ ] Consumer - Resource Model
    - [ ] Balance Points and Viability
    - [ ] Attractor Around Balance Point
        - [ ] What is the nature of the attractor?
            - Is it that when C and R are away from the balance point their derivatives point toward the balance point? No, because then it would be a straight shot home. 
            - Is it that when F is away from the balance point its derivative points to the balance point on F? No, because if that were the case it would effectively get stuck at some random combination of C and R.
            - [ ] Study the oscillation that we actually see so that you can find a way of describing what it is doing and then show the conditions where that arises from the math. 
    - [ ] How Have Others Approached this Problem?
