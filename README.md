what ecosystems teach us about coexistence

## TODO

- [ ] Consumer - Resource Model
    - [ ] Balance Points and Viability
    - [ ] Attractor Around Balance Point
        - [ ] What is the nature of the attractor?
            - Is it that when C and R are away from the balance point their derivatives point toward the balance point? No, because then it would be a straight shot home. 
            - Is it that when F is away from the balance point its derivative points to the balance point on F? No, because if that were the case it would effectively get stuck at some random combination of C and R.
            - [ ] Study the oscillation that we actually see so that you can find a way of describing what it is doing and then show the conditions where that arises from the math. 
    - [ ] How Have Others Approached this Problem?
     
## Format

A series of blog posts on individual interactions (we'll build up an argument by force of examples)

- For a species of management concern what does getting backed into a corner look like and what tools get deployed?
- How has this helped the species, in what situations can it fail it?
- How do we as humans end up overriding these? How have we or can we help it?
- How does this relate then to management?

Should focus on spatial management to start as that's where my other research is. 

TODO: want to refine these questions into some prompt engineering I can use in place of google search to get myself started.
