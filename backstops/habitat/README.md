# Habitat

## The Backstop

Not all habitat is created equal. Some habitats serve better against 
predators than others. It is also true that as a habitat fills up its 
value to each individual is likely to diminish. It is not hard to 
believe then that this creates a kind of density dependent fitness 
gradient due to habitat alone because either:

1. Creatures will distribute themselves across the habitats from best to
worst dynamically according to density or
2. Predators will pick off the prey that are easiest to get to first 

This in turn can give us the backstop required to protect against mutual 
extinction cases in predator prey interactions.

Some reading on this:

Some examples of actual habitat selection:

It is important to note that not all of these habitat shifts are due to density dependence of the prey alone, they 
can also be caused by the densities of the predator as well. 

Furthermore one must acknowledge that habitat shifts can only happen if better habitat is available. 
As noted by Shepherd and Litvak and Morris free ideal distributions don't necessarily show up in 
reality because there are many additional obstacles to keep in mind when individuals are trying to 
emigrate.
