## The Overall Idea

The basis of coexistence amongst victims and aggressors seems to come down to the idea 
the environment that arises when a victim population is truly pressed actually accentuates their 
fitness as compared to their aggressors. Another way of looking at this is that species have specific 
capabilities and dynamics that they fall back on in times of duress. 

From this perspective the question of our own coexistence with the world around us comes down, in part,
to ensuring there are fallbacks for the species we ourselves consume (whether for food or other reasons). 
If there is no such thing then it is up entirely to us to catch the dwindling of a species and correct 
our behavior in time - something that has rarely, if ever, happened. Giving species a backstop means 
they'll be fine even if we screw up. 

Examples of such backstops include things like marine protected areas, slot limits, limiting mortality 
to smaller fish, preventing mortality of females, and so on. All of these ensure that even if "infinite"
pressure was placed by a fishery its scope is a small subset of the full species and so "infinite" pressure
becomes finite. 

I'm interested in throwing together an anthology of sorts where each of these kinds of strategies is illuminated.
Specifically I'd like to (1) understand what makes the strategy work, (2) how it relates back to this idea 
of a fitness "backstop" as described above, (3) when this strategy can fail, and (4) who is pursuing strategies
like this. The way I'd like to frame it is as (a) illustrate the life history/fitness dynamics being leveraged,
(b) show how this translates into a management strategy, (c) give a case study of success and of failure, 
(d) draw some general conclusions about the approach. 

The purpose of each of the pieces in the anthology would be to give a succinct but engaging way of demonstrating
one specific piece of evidence toward the thesis outlined above. Over time, with enough of these pieces, I believe
it will provide a "proof by exhaustion" that this is a very practical and fruitful approach to addressing 
ecological management and more precisely human/ecology coexistence. 

Points of Clarification:

- The examples must come from real, on-the-ground management or biology, avoiding purely theoretical, mathematical, or controlled ecological modeling.
- The purpose is to determine the kinds of backstops available and how they function, rather than rigidly defining the term.
- Success for each strategy would demonstrate that these backstops prevent irreparable harm to species, even under suboptimal human management.

## Startup Strategy for Each Backstop

Compose a section of the anthology that captures the specific backstop hinted at above. Follow the guide presented in the overall idea. Specifically, make sure you:

1. Describe the life history or fitness dynamics that make the backstop work.
2. Detail a management strategy based on the backstop.
3. Include at least one case study that demonstrates success and another that highlights potential failure.
4. Identify the people, places, and organizations involved in implementing the strategy.

Be as specific as possible in examples and details. This will serve as a starting point for further expansion, so the information you uncover should provide clear insights into the mechanics, challenges, and outcomes of habitat-based backstops.

ChatGPT is great at giving starting points but lacks rigor so have it expand on the outcome of the above specifically to start pointing you at papers and authors. 

- Grab a series of examples from the outcome of the above
- Go through them and then be specific with ChatGPT about what was helpful vs not and get a new list
- Repeat until you have what you need
