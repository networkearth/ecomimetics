    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest cases, what allows for coexistence? \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with Chesson's model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_i(t) = r_i^0 \\left( 1 - \\sum_j \\alpha_{ij} N_j \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is more or less saying that the growth rate of a species is offset by the density of both itself and \n",
    "other species (assuming all the $\\alpha_{ij}$ are positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the result that comes from this (at least for a two species model) is that if the effect of a species on itself\n",
    "is stronger than the effect it has on other species (i.e. $\\alpha_{ii} > \\alpha_{ij}$), then the two species can coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because whatever decrease in growth rate the species creates on other groups is more than offset by the decrease in growth rate it creates on itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a nice insight but it depends on what is basically the assumption of a carrying capacity for each species. What happens\n",
    "if we bound the growth of a specific specifically on resources being present? I.e. what happens if we have a simple consumer model? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Consumer-Resource Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the idea that for the resource (say a plant species) if there were no consumers the growth would be limited\n",
    "by the density of the resource itself (no parents means no kids) and then at some point it would exhaust the available supplies\n",
    "to make new plants (i.e. the carrying capacity). So without a consumer we have a simple logistic growth model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt}=r(1-R/K)R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the resource and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we need to go ahead and add in a consumer. Let's start by modeling how much the consumer eats. On the one hand if the the resource is spectacularly abundant then the consumer will simply get full. So there is some maximum consumption rate that the consumer can eat. We'll designate this maximum rate as $cC$ where $C$ is the density of the consumer and $c$ is the maximum consumption rate of the consumer per unit of consumer density. Now one might wonder why a consumer wouldn't just always consume at the maximum rate. Problem is that the consumer has to be able to find resources to consume and theoretically \n",
    "as the density of the resource drops the consumer will have to spend more time looking for resources and less time eating. So we'll model the consumption rate as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cC\\frac{R}{R+S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the half saturation constant of the consumer. This is a common model for consumer-resource interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we now have for the resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt}=r(1-R/K)R - cC\\frac{R}{R+S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the positive growth rate of the consumer we need to multiply the consumption rate by the efficiency of conversion of the resource into consumer biomass. We'll call this efficiency $e$. So the growth rate of the consumer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC}{dt}=ecC\\frac{R}{R+S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However we also need to account for the fact that there are basic metabolic requirements and if these are not met the consumers\n",
    "will begin to die off. We'll model this as a simple linear death rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC}{dt}=ecC\\frac{R}{R+S} - mC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the death rate of the consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions/Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can the consumer drive itself to extinction? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well if $C=0$ then the growth rate is also zero and the consumer is done for. So the question is really whether there exists a region of the space where the derivative is just generally negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC}{dt}=\\left(ec\\frac{R}{R+S} - m\\right)C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is whether the term in the parentheses is negative. We first must assume that if $R$ is very large then the consumer will be able to grow. So $ec > m$. Let's define $ec/m = \\gamma$ as the growth efficiency of the consumer. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC}{dt}=\\left(\\gamma\\frac{R}{R+S} - 1\\right)mC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore find that if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma < \\frac{R+S}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the consumer is in trouble. Let's think about what this really means... If $\\gamma$ is very close to 1 it means that the consumer is more or less only supplying its own metabolic needs and therefore any reduction in its ability to find food will lead to its extinction. This doesn't necessarily mean that it depends on a very high biomass because $S$ could be very small. Indeed $S$ being very small means the consumer is good at finding food even when there is only a little food around. More or less what we are saying is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer is balancing its ability to find food with its ability to convert food into positive biomass. If it is good \n",
    "at finding food it can survive converting poorly. If it converts really well it can deal with having trouble finding food. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall though for a given $\\gamma$ and $S$ there is a critical value of $R$ where the consumer will begin to die off. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma \\frac{R}{R+S} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Gives us this critical point. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{S}{\\gamma - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question of whether the consumer can drive itself extinct is therefore whether the interaction between the consumer \n",
    "and the resource can drive the resource below this critical point and keep it there even as $C \\rightarrow 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the resource not grow?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt}=\\left(r(1-R/K) - cC\\frac{1}{R+S}\\right)R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resource will not grow when the term in the parentheses is negative. This is a bit more complicated than the consumer because the resource is directly dependent on its own density. However what we can see is that as $C$ increases the \n",
    "growth rate of the resource will go down and that eventually it will become negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so here's how this plays out. Assuming both $C$ and $R$ are non-negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $R>R_{crit}$ then $C$ will grow, regardless of the density of $C$. \n",
    "2. As $C$ and $R$ grows the growth rate of $R$ will decrease until eventually it flips.\n",
    "3. If $R<R_{crit}$ then $C$ will die off. This will improve the growth rate of $R$ until eventually $R$ grows again.\n",
    "4. Once it hits $R_{crit}$ the cycle will repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly $C$ cannot drive itself to extinction because eventually at low enough densities $R$ will begin to grow again and \n",
    "eventually hit the critical point. What's weird about this model though is that if $R=R_{crit}$ then $C$ will grow \n",
    "no matter how much biomass there is... \n",
    "\n",
    "This is happening because of a weird piece of the model being instantaneous. For example if $C$ is near infinite then it will \n",
    "draw a near infinite amount of resource for a near infinitesimal period of time. This works in the model but of course does not make any sense. One other way of putting this is that our model doesn't actually limit the instantaenous draw on the resource. \n",
    "Therefore the instantaneous rate can far exceed the actual amount of resource present. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model we're going to expect that the ratio of $C$ to $R$ is what controls the consumption rate (that is the number of resources consumed per unit of consumer biomass). We'll call this ratio the fill $F$. As $F\\rightarrow 0$ the consumer will have loads of food available and will end up consuming at the maximum rate. As $F\\rightarrow \\infty$ the consumer will have to spend more time looking for food and will consume less until eventually it finds no food at all. So we can propose the following model for the consumption rate $c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c=\\frac{c_{max}}{1+\\alpha F}=\\frac{c_{max}}{1+\\alpha (C/R)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And therefore we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt}=r(1-R/K)R - cC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC}{dt}=ecC - mC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's go look for the critical point where the consumer stops growing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ec-m=0 \\rightarrow \\frac{c_{max}}{1+\\alpha F}e-m=0\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha F}=m/(ec_{max})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1+\\alpha (C/R) = \\gamma \\rightarrow R = \\frac{\\alpha C}{\\gamma - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if $\\alpha$ is very large it means (roughly speaking) the equivalent to $S$ being very large, i.e. the consumer isn't very good at finding food. If $\\alpha$ is very small it means the consumer is very good at finding food. What we find here though\n",
    "is that the critical point is now dependent on the density of the consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also reverse it and say if the $R$ remained constant, what's the critical point of $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1+\\alpha (C/R) = \\gamma \\rightarrow C = \\frac{(\\gamma -1)}{\\alpha}R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the carrying capacity of $C$ is linearly related to $R$. This suggests that if $C$ is over capacity (which it will eventually be) and $R$ begins to shrink, if $C$ can't keep up it will always be over capacity and the two will suppress \n",
    "each other. **Why doesn't that happen?**\n"
